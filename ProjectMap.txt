Below is a complete code project map that is broadly in the
order the code needs to be run. Exceptions to running the 
code sequentially are the modules called from a file
are included in this description. 

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Build
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1) This code takes HUD Zip code and Tract data and combines it with
   ACS population data at the zip code level. It assigns a tract to a single
   zip code based on the number people living in tract-zip combos. It outputs a file
   called ".\Data\Intermediate\ZCTA_Tract_Crosswalk.dta". This file is used to link
   zip codes and tracts. 
 
   ".\Code\Build\ZCTA_Tract_crosswalk.do"

2) Collapse the FCC data to the census block level and to the zip code level
   in seperate datasets. 
 
   ".\Code\Build\Collapse_FCC.do" 

3) Build a crosswalk between Zip Codes and School District LEA IDS
   ".\Code\Build\SchoolDistrict_ZipCode_Crosswalk.py"

4) Stack CCD

   ".\Code\Build\Clean_and_Stack_CCD.py"

5) Collapse the SEDA data to a usable file. Merge in the Zip code to LEA IDS
   Cross walk.
  
   ".\Code\Build\CleanSeda.do"

6) This code builds a list of nces school id and zip code pairs for the 
   catchement zones of each Stride K-12 school. 
   
   ".\Code\Build\Stride_catchmentzones.py"

7) The major build file that pulls all of the data toghether.
   Merges the Stride K12 data with catchement zones and FCC data.
   Pull in other data: ACS data, RUCA, Reservations, SEDA Data, CCD. 
   
   ".\Code\Build\AnalyticDFConstruction.py"


/////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Analysis
/////////////////////////////////////////////////

8) Run summary statistics on the Common Core data and produce state level datasets
   that is used to map total online enrollment by state over time. Creates 
   table 1 and figure 2. 

   ".\Code\Figures_Summary_Stats\CCD_stride_summarystatistics.do"

9) Map Virtual School Enrollment as a Percent of Total School Enrollment. Creates
   figure 1.
  
   ".\Code\Figures_Summary_Stats\virtual_enrollment_by_state.py"

10) Produce table 2 i.e. compare stride and neighborhood school district characteristic
    ".\Code\Figures_Summary_Stats\Stride_VS_NeighborhoodSD.do"

11) Figure 3: Neighborhood and Virual school racial compositions 

    ".\Code\Figures_Summary_Stats\SchoolSeg.do"

12) Table 3 Regression results
    Runs the bootstrapped main models. Relies on a user written command
    poissonbootstrap, located in the modules folder. Step 14 below actually
    produces the table coefs. The bootstrapped models here produce a 1000 coef
    estimates that then need to be combined. 

    ".\Code\Models\Models_10082021.do"

13) Module used to compute 1000 bootstrapped coeffience and is called by the
    Models_10082021.do file.
  
    ".\Code\Modules\poissonbootstrap.do"

14) Format the coefficients generated by steps 12 and 13. Calls the 
    module formatcoefs. Creates Table 3.

    ".\Code\Models\Coefs_10082021.do"

15) Takes the coefficient estimates from steps 12 and 13 and computes a 
    grand mean, standard error, and p-values. It is a module called by step
    14. 

    ".\Code\Modules\formatcoefs.do"

16) Run a Chow test to see if coefs differe by race/ethnicity
    
    do ".\Code\Figures_Summary_Stats\race_chow_test.do"

17) Since the Chow test shows that the coefs do differ, we want to run
    models specific for Black, Hispanic, and White students (3 most populous
    racial groups). Creates table 4.
 
    ".\Code\Models\ModelsByRace_10252021.do"
