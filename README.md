# The Pre-Pandemic Growth in Online Public Education and the Factors that Predict It

<h2> Abstract <h2>

 
<sub>The spring of 2020 introduced virtual instruction to all public schools in the United States. But virtual public schooling had been growing in most states well before it was ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic. We focus on pre-COVID-19 changes to full-time virtual school enrollment in public schools and the factors that predict enrollment. Relying on data from Stride, a large, virtual school education management organization, we provide descriptive evidence on the relationship between virtual school enrollment, broadband access and quality, community demographics, and traditional (brick-and-mortar) K-12 school achievement levels. We find negative associations between online enrollment and both income and test achievement in neighborhood brick-and-mortar schools. There is also evidence that enrollment rises nonlinearly with internet speed; in particular, low internet speed appears to act as a constraint on enrolling in virtual schools, while improvements to already fast internet speeds are not associated with rises to enrollment. There is some evidence that virtual school enrollment depends on the demographics of neighborhood public schools, with students less likely to enroll in virtual schools as the share of students of their own demographic in neighborhood schools increases, but these results are not consistent across specifications.</sub>
